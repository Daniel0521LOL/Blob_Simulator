# Blob_Simulator
Blobs in an environment simulating Natural Selection (but I'm still working on the second part though).

A bunch of circular blobs, put into an environment with food. The blobs will try to find food to eat and survive. My goal is to eventually create something like what Primer (the Youtuber) achived. I am still a noob middle school programmer who can't wrap his head around Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm but I and doing my best to perfect this project. Anyways, hope this will be interesting to you!
